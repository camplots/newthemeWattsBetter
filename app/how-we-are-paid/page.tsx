              An installer&apos;s hardest problem isn&apos;t price. It&apos;s finding a customer
              who already knows what they need.

              We solve that before we make an introduction — through the assessment, the report,
              the consultation and the photo capture. A well-briefed customer is worth real money
              to a good installer: fewer wasted visits, fewer design revisions, fewer surprises.

            <ReportP>
              Most comparison services hand your details to several installers and let them
              compete on price. You get three quotes, and the job of working out which one is
              real.
            </ReportP>
            <p className="mt-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              We do the opposite. One installer, chosen against our criteria — licensing, who
              actually performs the work, how customers are supported afterwards, and whether
              they&apos;ll cooperate with an independent inspection of their own work.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              The trade-off, stated plainly: you don&apos;t get competing quotes. What you get
              instead is a benchmark — your report tells you what your home needs, what it should
              cost, and what to ask. You&apos;re checking one quote against something
              independent, not against other quotes.

              an introduction commits you to nothing.
